# Q8b
Python architecture for sourcing, sensing and controlling single or multiple MZIs through the Q8b driver module from Qontrol Ltd. (https://qontrol.co.uk/product/q8b/)
The system is able to voltage control one or more MZIs through proper Q8b outputs and retrieve voltage and current measurements from the Q8b and voltage measurements from a Picoscope 4224 oscilloscope.
Each measurement is saved with a pre-determined formatting into .txt files and plotted in a MATLab-like plot.
The system is also able to simulate both a single MZI and multiple MZIs with tunable parameters displaying dinamically its/their output.
