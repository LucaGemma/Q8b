_Qontrol and Picoscope IF.ipynb_ : interactive python notebook for performing triangular voltage sweeping over one or multiple channels of the Q8b driver module. It measures their voltages and currents through Q8b and the voltage of an additional channel through a connected Picoscope 4224 (via picosdk). Data are visualized in a graphical way (via matplotlib).

_Pico_Tester.ipynb_ : interactive python notebook for testing the basic functionalities of the picosdk package for a Picoscope 4224.

_Keithley_Tester.ipynb_ : interactive python notebook for testing the basic functionalities of the pymeasure package for a Keithley 2450.
